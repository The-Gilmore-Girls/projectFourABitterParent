# A Bitter Parent

This application uses the Nutritionix API, React & Firebase.  When a user suggests a food to eat, the app suggests a healthier food with at least 10g less sugar (sometimes 5g less sugar if it feels nice).  The user can save the food pairs to a list and view them on a separate page.

Created by Zeynab Manafova, Lou Saint-Andre, Cam Remesz, and Kevin Kilarski.  Additional work post-fork provided by Kevin Kilarski.
